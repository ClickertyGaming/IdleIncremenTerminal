# IdleIncremenTerminal
A fully fledged idle incremental game made in C++ running entirely within Windows Terminal.

At the moment, not much to look at. I'm working on it, I promise. Once I have enough, this repository will look prettier.

## Prerequisites
- MinGW
- g++

## Install
Download the repository as a ZIP file.
```
g++ main.cpp
```

## Usage
Run the compiled executable and a Terminal window will open. That's it. Enjoy.
